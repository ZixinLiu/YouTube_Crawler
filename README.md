# YouTube_Crawler

Get all categories(user defined) on Youtube, and crawl top 50 youtube videos (if possible) for each category.

For approximate 1000 videos, crawl all comments for each video and also collect the userchannelId, username for poeple who posted comments.

Output are json objects. (output data are not list here, ~4.gb output)


Later, I am going to clean data(remove emoji, remove comments are not in English) and to I going to use cleaned data to build and train models using 
Natural Language Processing algorithms for later prediction.
